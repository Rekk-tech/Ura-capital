# FEAT-065 Plan: AI Rate Limits, Daily Quotas & Cost Controls

Status: HUMAN MASTER PLANNING CONDITIONALLY APPROVED / IMPLEMENTATION NOT_STARTED
Phase: Phase 8 - Aura Intelligence

## Preconditions

- Human approves the Phase 8 master plan, this package, and the listed decision dependencies.
- Work starts from the exact approved dependency checkpoint in an isolated worktree and feature branch.
- Shared-file ownership and integration checkpoint are assigned before edits.
- No implementation uses the planning branch as an application baseline.

## Delivery Plan

1. Record exact baseline SHA, branch, worktree, dependencies, and zero-scope exclusions.
2. Implement the approved architecture and contracts for FR-001 through FR-010.
3. Add requirement-mapped tests, security probes, boundary checks, and regression coverage.
4. Verify migration ownership and inspect the diff for scope leakage.
5. Run targeted validation, canonical repository validation, authoritative guards, and exact-source CI.
6. Publish reports/implementation/phase-8/FEAT-065.md with exact evidence and no independent-QA claim.
7. Create an approved checkpoint only after the applicable feature gate and CI policy pass.
8. Keep downstream features blocked until the approved dependency/integration checkpoint exists.

## Proposed File Ownership

Proposed ownership: apps/api/src/modules/ai/quota/**, approved Redis namespace helpers, AI quota tests, composition/configuration coordination, and the feature report.

## Parallel And Shared-File Controls

Changes outside proposed ownership require integration-owner coordination. Shared environment schemas, package manifests/lockfiles, root server/router composition, shared AI DTO exports, repository composition, and Redis namespace helpers are serialized according to the master plan.

## Migration Plan

ZERO. Redis state is transient and TTL-bound; no PostgreSQL quota table is introduced.

Fresh/upgrade migration validation is required only if an explicitly Human-approved migration is introduced. Otherwise schema and migration diff must remain zero and existing migration guards stay green.

## Verification Plan

- Map every task to its FR and AC.
- Run targeted unit/contract/security tests.
- Run live authority-backed tests where applicable.
- Run lint, typecheck, build, Prisma validation, all authoritative guards, and relevant regression.
- Record actual counts and exact-source CI; do not copy historical counts.
- Antigravity may self-verify but may not claim independent QA.
- After P8-D05 approval, prove the exact section-12.3 thresholds, UTC reset, one-step atomic reservation, conservative timeout/cancellation accounting, multi-instance behavior, post-settlement recovery, and literal configured global ceiling with live Redis and deterministic clocks.

## Rollback And Failure

Application rollout remains disabled until the feature gate passes. Configuration and adapter changes must fail closed. No rollback may edit an applied migration. Any architecture, schema, privacy, cost, or product-scope conflict stops for Human review.

## Human Decision Handoff

- P8-D04: APPROVED - all authenticated users may access Aura Intelligence subject to quotas; no premium gate.
- P8-D05: APPROVED WITH BLOCKER - section 12.3 contains the candidate policy; Human confirmation and a literal global USD amount remain required.
- P8-D15: PENDING - provider comparison/selection may supply pricing inputs but cannot bypass or re-own quota enforcement.
- Implementation readiness: DEPENDENCY BLOCKED by FEAT-058 and BLOCKED from completion by the remaining P8-D05 parameters.
